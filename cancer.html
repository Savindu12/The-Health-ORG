                <p><br><br>Normally, human cells grow and multiply to form new cells when the body needs them. This  process is called cell division. When cells become old or damaged, they die and new cells take their place.<br></p> 
                <p><br>Cancer is a disease in which some of the cells in body grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body which is made up of trillions of cells grouped to form tissues and organs.  Some posiible signs and symptoms of cancer are lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough unexplained weight loss, bowel moment. <br></p>

		<h2 class="title2">Causes</h2>
		<img src="cancer image/cancer-affetcted-dna18-copy.png" class="img2" ><br><br>
		<p class="para2">Human body is made up of trillions of cells and genes inside the nucleus of each cell gives instructions to the cell when to grow, work, divide and die. Normally, the cells follow the instructions and keep the body heathy. When there is a change in DNA or damage to it, gene can mutate. Due to mutation ,the instructions in their DNA get mixed up and genes do not work properly. This cause cell to divide and grow out of control, which can lead to cancer. The gene mutation may be inherited or something damage the genes.<br><br>

                        In the normal cell division process, one cell divides into 1 identical cell, then two cells divide into 4 and so on. Cancer cells are different. Mutated genes in the cell that turn the normal cell into cancer cell. Cancer can start in any cell in the body. Cancer cell does not act like a normal cell. It starts to grow and divide out of control. Also, they do not mature as normal cell. Then they stay immature.</p>



	
		<h2 class="title2"><br>Growth</h2>
	
		<p class="para2"><br>Genetic mutations in cancer cells can interfere with the normal instruction in cells and prevent it from growing or dying uncontrollably when it dies. A cancer can continue the growth because of the  cancer cells are different from normal cells. They,<br><br>


				<ul class="ul1">

									<li>Divide out of control</li>
									<li>Do not mature as normal cell with specific jobs</li>
									<li>Avoid the immune system</li>
									<li>Ignore the instructions that they should stop dividing or die</li>
									<li>Do not stick well and spreads to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system</li>
									<li>Grow and damage tissues and organs</li>
				</ul><br><br></p>


	<p class="para3">When cancer cells divide, a tumor will develop. As the normal cell, cancer cells need blood supply to carry oxygen and nutrients for growth and survival. When the tumor grows, it receives oxygen and nutrients from nearby blood vessels. Also, cancer cells send signals for a tumor to make new blood vessels to received more blood. Then tumor grow and get bigger. This is called angiogenesis. It allows cancer cells to get into the blood and spread to other parts of the body.</p>

<h2 class="title2"><br>Spread</h2>
 
		
		<p class="para2"><br>Most cancers have a possibility to spread from where  it started to other parts of the body. It is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from the tumor and travel to new location in the body through the blood or lymphatic system. Mostly, cancer spread to lymph nodes,bones,brain,liver or lungs.<br><br>

When tumor grows, cancer cells also can spread to surrounding tissues and structures. It makes enzymes that break down normal cells and tissues. Cancer that grows into nearby tissue is called local invasion or invasive cancer.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="box6">

			

			<p>Many cancers can be cured with treatments. Treatments are varying with the type of cancer, its stage. The goal of the treatment is to kill cancerous cells and reducing damage to normal cells. The main treatments are, 

					<ul class="treats">
				
				<li>Chemotherapy:- Special drugs to shrink or destroy cancer cells.</li>
				<li>Radiation therapy:- The use of high-energy radiation (similar to X-rays) to destroy cancer cells.</li>
				<li>Hormone therapy:- Blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow.</li>
				<li>Immunotherapy:- A treatment that works in conjunction with your body's immune system to fight cancer cells or control the side effects of other cancer treatments.</li>
				<li>Stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant): Replace bone marrow cells that have been lost due to overdose of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It is most commonly used to treat leukemia and lymphoma.</li>

			</ul>

		<h3 class>Recurrence</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="box6">

		

			<p>The cancer that is thought to be cured can come back even years after. If one cancer cell is left behind after the treatment,it can grow and divide to become a new tumor.The new tumor grow in the same area of the body  and may spread through the blood or lymphatic system to other parts of the body, where it grows into a new tumor.<br><br>
			Some gene mutation makes cancer cells resistant to treatment like chemotherapy, drug treatment. Then cancer cells cannot be destroyed and start to grow again and get bigger.
