                <p>The kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped organs found in vertebrates.
                    They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space,
                     and in adult humans are about 12 centimetres (4+1⁄2 inches) in length.[1][2] They receive blood 
                     from the paired renal arteries;
                      blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries
                       excreted urine to the bladder.<br><br>

                    The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality,
                     acid–base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. Filtration occurs
                      in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. Examples of 
                      substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids.<br><br> Examples
                       of substances secreted are hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. The kidneys also carry out functions 
                       independent of the nephron. For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol;
                        and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin. The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the
                         kidney. Each adult human kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 
                         12,500 nephrons.</p>

                    The kidneys job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes, control the body's fluid balance,
                     and keep the right levels of electrolytes. All of the blood in your body passes through them several times a day.
                     <br>
                      Blood comes into the kidney, waste gets removed, and salt, water, and minerals are adjusted, if needed.

                    <li>   Kidney infections caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics. Often, cultures of the blood or urine can help guide the choice of antibiotic therapy.  </li>
                    <li>   Nephrostomy: A tube (catheter) is placed through the skin into the kidney. Urine then drains directly from the kidney, bypassing any blockages in urine flow. </li>
                    <li>   Lithotripsy: Some kidney stones may be shattered into small pieces that can pass in the urine. Most often, lithotripsy is done by a machine that projects ultrasound shock waves through the body. </li>
                    <li>    Nephrectomy: Surgery to remove a kidney. Nephrectomy is performed for kidney cancer or severe kidney damage.</li>
                    <li>   Dialysis: Artificial filtering of the blood to replace the work that damaged kidneys can't do. Hemodialysis is the most common method of dialysis in the U.S. </li>
                    <li>   Hemodialysis: A person with complete kidney failure is connected to a dialysis machine, which filters the blood and returns it to the body. Hemodialysis is typically done 3 days per week in people with ESRD. </li>
                    <li>   Peritoneal dialysis: Placing large amounts of a special fluid in the abdomen through a catheter allows the body to filter the blood using the natural membrane lining the abdomen. After a while, the fluid with the waste is drained and discarded. </li>
                    <li>   Kidney transplant: Transplanting a kidney into a person with ESRD can restore kidney function. A kidney may be transplanted from a living donor, or from a recently deceased organ donor. </li>

                    <li> Cook with a mix of spices instead of salt.</li>
                    <li>  Choose veggie toppings such as spinach, broccoli, and peppers for your pizza.</li>
                    <li>  Try baking or broiling meat, chicken, and fish instead of frying.</li>
                    <li>  Serve foods without gravy or added fats.</li>
                    <li> Try to choose foods with little or no added sugar.
                    </li>
                    <li> Gradually work your way down from whole milk to 2 percent milk until you’re drinking and cooking with fat-free (skim) or low-fat milk and milk products.
                    </li>
                    <li> Eat foods made from whole grains—such as whole wheat, brown rice, oats, and whole-grain corn—every day. Use whole-grain bread for toast and sandwiches; substitute brown rice for white rice for home-cooked meals and when dining out.
                    </li>
                    <li> Read food labels. Choose foods low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars.
                    </li>
                    <li> Slow down at snack time. Eating a bag of low-fat popcorn takes longer than eating a slice of cake. Peel and eat an orange instead of drinking orange juice.
                    </li>
                    <li> Try keeping a written record of what you eat for a week. It can help you see when you tend to overeat or eat foods high in fat or calories.
